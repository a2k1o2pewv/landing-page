        "you": "What are superconductors?",
        "khoj": "Superconductors are materials that can conduct electric current with zero electrical resistance when cooled below a certain critical temperature. In other words, they allow the flow of electric current without any loss of energy due to resistance. This unique property of superconductors has various practical applications, such as in powerful electromagnets, high-speed trains (maglev), MRI machines, particle accelerators, and more. Superconductors have also been a subject of scientific research due to their potential for revolutionizing energy transmission and storage systems.",

        "you": "What gets unlocked once we have room temperature superconductors?",
        "khoj": "Room temperature superconductors, if achieved, would have a profound impact on various fields and technologies. For instance, room temperature superconductors could revolutionize power transmission by enabling the efficient and lossless transmission of electricity over long distances. This could lead to significant reductions in energy waste and more efficient electrical grids. Superconductors could enhance the performance and efficiency of computing systems, enabling faster and more powerful computers. Additionally, they could contribute to the development of advanced data storage technologies with higher capacities and faster data transfer rates.",

        Ingredients:
        - 2 cups water
        - 2 cups milk
        - 2-3 teaspoons loose black tea leaves (or 2-3 tea bags)
        - 4-5 whole green cardamom pods, lightly crushed
        - 1 small piece of fresh ginger, peeled and grated
        `
    },
    {
        "you": "How can I make chai using those ingredients?",
        "khoj": `Instructions:
        1. In a saucepan, add water and bring it to a boil.
        2. Once the water is boiling, add the tea leaves or tea bags, cardamom pods, and grated ginger (if using).
        3. Reduce the heat to low and let the mixture simmer for about 5 minutes to allow the flavors to infuse.
        4. Add milk to the saucepan and bring the mixture to a gentle simmer. Continue simmering for another 2-3 minutes, or until the chai reaches your desired strength and sweetness.
        6. Remove the saucepan from heat and strain the chai to remove the tea leaves and spices.
        7. Pour the chai into cups or mugs and serve hot.

        Feel free to adjust the ingredients according to your taste preferences. You can also experiment with adding other spices like nutmeg or cardamom powder for additional flavor. Enjoy your homemade chai! Let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with.

        "khoj": "I'm sorry to hear that your roses aren't growing as fast as you expected. I would recommend checking the soil pH and making sure it's between 6.5 and 7.5. If the pH is too low, you can add lime to raise it. If the pH is too high, you can add sulfur to lower it. You should also make sure that the soil is well-drained and that the roses are getting enough sunlight. If you have any other questions, please let me know."

        "you": "Hm, do you think the issue could be fertilizer?",

Follow the recommended application rates and timing to provide the necessary nutrients for healthy growth. Nitrogen-rich fertilizers can promote foliage growth, while phosphorus and potassium can support flower production."
